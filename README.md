🌼 # Pollen Grain Classification System
A deep learning-powered web application for identifying plant species from pollen grain images

📌 Overview
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify pollen grains into 23 different plant species. The system provides a user-friendly web interface where researchers can upload microscope images of pollen grains and receive instant species identification with confidence percentages.

✨ Key Features
Deep Learning Model: Custom CNN architecture trained on thousands of pollen images

Web Interface: Flask-based application with responsive design

Image Processing: Automatic resizing and normalization of input images

Visual Results: Displays prediction with confidence meter and sample image

User Experience: Drag-and-drop upload, loading animations, and helpful tips

🛠️ Technical Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Machine Learning: CNN, Image Augmentation, Transfer Learning

DevOps: GitHub, Python packaging
